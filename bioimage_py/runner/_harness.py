"""Worker entry point for distributed tasks.

Invoked as ``python -m bioimage_py.runner._harness <tempdir> <task_id>``. Loads the
cloudpickled payload, reopens the sources from their specs, runs the assigned blocks via
the shared :func:`bioimage_py.runner.base.run_block`, and writes one result file followed
by one success sentinel (writing the result first guarantees a sentinel never advertises a
missing or partial result).
